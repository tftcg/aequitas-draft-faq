Does "outside the game" refer to the sideboard? The other question is if I play Brainstorm with Wave 3 Skywarp on the field, how do I proceed if I have 2 Defensive Formations at hand? Do I play the 1st Defensive Formation, draw a card and then play the 2nd Defensive Formation to draw a 2nd card? Or do I play the 1st defensive formation, then the 2nd, and then draw the 2 cards?

      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        
It can refer to your sideboard, however your “outside the game” cards do not have to be in your sideboard to be considered detectable by the game.
In resolving the Brainstorm, you will play both Defensive Formations. Skywarp’s ability will trigger for each of them, but you won’t draw cards for the ability until you’ve finished resolving the Brainstorm.

If Reclaim is the last card in your deck and Major Shockwave is in Bot mode, when he uses his continuous effect to play the top Secret Action/Decepticon card of your deck as if it were in your hand, will Reclaim resolve its effect first and put the selected upgrade on top of the deck, or will the deck need to be shuffled immediately since there zero cards left in the main deck?

I have run into a situation where my deck had no cards and no discard pile to shuffle in. We ruled it as when I attacked or defended, I had no cards to flip so I added 0 to my attack and defense. We were wondering if this would be a proper ruling.

Second, for the card Inverted. It says that each orange pip you flip becomes a blue pip and vice versa. For cards that rely on you flipping a certain color pip, do the pips flipped count as what they are, or the inverted color?

        <span><a href="https://transformerstcg-support.wizards.com/hc/en-us/articles/360033067552-Rules-Roundup-8-9-19"><img src="https://tftcg.info/images/source-red.svg" title="Rules Roundup 2019-08-09"/></a></span>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        
If your deck and scrap pile are empty, you don't flip any cards and the game proceeds.

For Inverted, there's no sequence when the icon changes from one color to another. They are changed from the moment Inverted is played and stay so as long as Inverted is on the character.
