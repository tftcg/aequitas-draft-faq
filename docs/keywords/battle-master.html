          What are Battle Masters?

      <div class="answer">
        
Battle Masters are characters that start in bot mode and can be played in their upgrade mode
after they are KO’d. Battle Masters don’t have an alt mode and can’t flip while they are on the
battlefield. There are both Autobot and Decepticon Battle Masters.

      <div class="question">
        
             Battle Masters are the same size as battle cards! What does that mean?
        
        <span><a href="https://transformerstcg.hasbro.com/en-us/howtoplay"><img src="/images/source-gold.svg" title="Wave 2 and 3 FAQ"/></a></span>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        
             The size of the card doesn’t change how they play. While in bot mode, Battle Masters are
just like other characters. They can attack and be attacked, they can be damaged, they can be
upgraded, and so on.

      <div class="question">
        
             If a card tells me to flip a Battle Master, what happens?
        
        <span><a href="https://transformerstcg.hasbro.com/en-us/howtoplay"><img src="/images/source-gold.svg" title="Wave 2 and 3 FAQ"/></a></span>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        
             It doesn’t flip. It just stays in bot mode. If the card has additional instructions, those are still
followed if possible.

             So how do I access the upgrade mode?

      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        
             If a Battle Master in bot mode is KO’d, you can immediately flip the card and play its other
mode.

      <div class="question">
        
             Most of the time, characters are KO’d on their opponent’s turn. If that happens to my Battle
Master, can I still play the upgrade?
        
        <span><a href="https://transformerstcg.hasbro.com/en-us/howtoplay"><img src="/images/source-gold.svg" title="Wave 2 and 3 FAQ"/></a></span>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        
             Yes. This may cause some abilities to trigger that normally don’t during your opponent’s turn.

      <div class="question">
        
             When I play the Battle Master in upgrade mode, does it count as my upgrade play for the
turn?
        
        <span><a href="https://transformerstcg.hasbro.com/en-us/howtoplay"><img src="/images/source-gold.svg" title="Wave 2 and 3 FAQ"/></a></span>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        
             No. If you played an upgrade earlier in the turn, you can still play the Battle Master in its
upgrade mode after it’s KO’d in bot mode.
In some unusual situations, your Battle Master in bot mode is KO’d during your turn before you
attack. Playing the upgrade mode in those situations doesn’t stop you from then playing an
upgrade from your hand before you attack.

      <div class="question">
        
             What happens if the Battle Master upgrade would leave the battlefield?
        
        <span><a href="https://transformerstcg.hasbro.com/en-us/howtoplay"><img src="/images/source-gold.svg" title="Wave 2 and 3 FAQ"/></a></span>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        
             If that happens, the card is put into your KO area with its upgrade mode face up. This can
happen if the upgrade would be returned to your hand, returned to your deck, directly
scrapped, or if the character that had it is KO’d.

      <div class="question">
        
             What are Battle Masters & Weaponizers?
        
        <span><a href="https://transformerstcg-support.wizards.com/hc/en-us/articles/360035662892-War-for-Cybertron-Siege-II-FAQ-and-Rules-Roundup"><img src="/images/source-gold.svg" title="Wave 4 FAQ"/></a></span>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        
Battle Masters and Weaponizers are characters that start in bot mode and can be played in their Upgrade mode after they are KO’d. They don’t have alt modes and can’t flip while they are on the battlefield.
In Siege 2 (Wave 4), there are two Weaponizers, each made up of two cards. They start assembled together in bot mode. When one of these Weaponizers is KO’d, it splits into two different Upgrades that you can then play. These Upgrades can be played on separate characters or onto the same character.
After a Battle Master or Weaponizer Upgrade would leave the battlefield, it’s put into your KO area instead.
