        What are Combiners?

        It would be hard to have a set called Rise of the Combiners without… the Combiners!<br/>Combiners are teams of characters that join in a third mode called Combiner mode. Most<br/>teams have a corresponding battle card called an Enigma that combines the team under the<br/>right circumstances. One Combiner in this set (Dreadwing - Sky Destroyer) has a different way<br/>of combining.<br/>When a character is combined, it starts untapped and it gets all the damage counters from the<br/>characters that formed it. It can keep upgrades from those characters based on its upgrade<br/>slots. Unless the Combiner says differently, it will have 1 Weapon slot, 1 Utility slot, and 1<br/>Armor slot like most characters. If there are too many Upgrades to fit into a slot, you can keep<br/>as many as you can fit, and the rest are scrapped.<br/>A character in Combiner mode is a single character, even though it’s made up of multiple cards.<br/>When it attacks, the whole thing becomes tapped. If it’s KO’d (and somehow you haven’t lost<br/>the game), it stays in Combiner mode in the KO area.<br/>A character in Combiner mode can’t flip. Ignore any instruction to flip it. Also, a character in<br/>Combiner mode can’t “break apart” into its individual cards.

        With the some of the new combiner teams being over 25 points, how does this work? Do the players decide on the points totals they’ll be playing or are you still only able to take 25 points and you’ll not be able to use this team to combine?

      <div class="answer">
        In a normal game, you must still adhere to the 25-star limit when building your deck, but Optimus Maximus and Volcanicus have special rules on their cards that explain how they function with more than 25 stars.

        The enigma cards state that all the of the combiner component characters must be “in bot mode on the battlefield and/or in your KO area”. Do they still have to be in bot mode if they are in the KO area? Given how Volcanicus is formed I assumed they could be in alt mode, but now that the new rules state you can flip characters in the KO area, I’m not so sure.

        When a Combiner combines and the upgrades on its components go onto it, does that count as putting it on a character in the same way that Swap Parts does? For example:  Torox has Energon Slingshot before Predacon Enigma was played.  When Predaking is combined into, will Slingshot count as being put on a melee character and have its ability to deal 1 damage activate?

      <div class="answer">
        No. Upgrades are not “put on” when Combining, they are “kept on”.
