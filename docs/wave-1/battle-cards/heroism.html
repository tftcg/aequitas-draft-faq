I have a question concerning Heroism, the Wave 1 Utility. I have Heroism on a character and place the Take Cover! secret action during my turn. During my opponent's turn I reveal Take Cover!. When my opponent goes to attack and the attack damage is transferred to the character with Heroism what type of damage is this? Heroism is a tad vague on the damage that the character is taking. If its not attack damage I assume that Take Cover! could blank the attack effectively?

      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        
Damage redirected by Heroism is still attack damage, so it is not affected by Take Cover.

If I played Heroism on Insecticon Leader Skrapnel, would the redirected attack damage to Skrapnel still be reduced to 3?

Yes, redirected damage from Heroism is still attack damage.

    Let’s say the Upgraded character also has Heroism. If another character would take 5 or more attack damage, what happens?

        <span><a href="https://wpn.wizards.com/en/document/transformers-tcg-faq"><img src="/images/source-gold.svg" title="Wave 1 FAQ"/></a></span>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        
    The damage that would be done to the defender is instead done to the character with Heroism and Force Field. That damage is still attack damage, so 4 damage is done to the Upgraded character instead.

    You can choose which of the characters will take the damage.

    Does the damage still count as attack damage?

    Yes. Any other card that cares about attack damage will still apply.

Secret Actions say they scrap at the end of my opponent's turn. If I Brainstorm, Secret Action, Peace Through Tyranny, how long does the Secret Action stay out? Will it stay out for my second turn, until it is my opponent's turn, and then scrap at the end of their turn? Or do Secret Actions just scrap at the end of the following turn, so it would scrap at the end of my second turn?

It will stay out for your second turn and scrap at the end of your opponent’s turn.
