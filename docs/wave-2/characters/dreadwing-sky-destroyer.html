        Finally, how does Dreadwing - Sky Destroyer’s combine ability work with this scenario? Does the “untap step” happen before the end of turn step? Do they happen in a sequence of the active player’s choice? Or does the untapping of all characters happen even before this?

      <div class="answer">
        Characters untap before the end of turn step, so you both players would untap all of their characters, then you could combine Dreadwing, then your opponent could start their turn.

        If Dreadwing - Sky Destroyer has 2 Spinner Rims attached and flips a white trigger on attacking, does he flip 1 extra battle card for each Spinner Rims attached, or just 1 extra?

      <div class="answer">
        Both copies of Spinner Rims will trigger and allow you to flip an extra Battle Card, for a total of two, in this scenario.

        What happens if you have 2 Aerial Recons on Dreadwing? Do you scrap the top card or not?

      <div class="answer">
        Any time more than 1 triggered ability triggers from the same action, do them in any order. For the first Aerial Recon, if you leave the card on the top of your deck, it will still be there for the second Aerial Recon.

        Dreadwind and Blackwing are both in the K.O. Area. If you combine them, Dreadwing would still be K.O.'d. What happens if you play I Still Function! on one of them, then combine them?
        <span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/transformers-trading-card-game/rules-roundup-218/2016630841792064/"><img src="/images/source-red.svg" title="Rules Roundup 2019-02-18"/></a> <a href="#Rules_Roundup-2019-02-18__218-21"><img src="/images/permalink.svg"/></a></span>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        Dreadwind and Blackwing cannot be combined if they are both in the K.O. Area because their abilities won’t work. If you use I Still Function! to return one of them to the Battlefield, at end of turn, two abilities happen: I Still Function K.O.’s the character and the combining ability of whichever character you brought back happens. If you combine first, then I Still Function! still applies and will K.O. a combined Dreadwing. If I Still Function! K.O.’s the character you brought back first, the combining ability won’t do anything, and you’ll have Dreadwind and Blackwing in K.O. separately. Essentially, you can have Dreadwing in K.O. or Dreadwind and Blackwing in K.O.

        So what happens when your opponent is tapped out and you attack with Blackwing/Dreadwind and combine at the end of your turn? Your attack step is over, right? Can you not attack with Dreadwing the turn he comes into play in that case? Does your opponent take a turn and not attack because their characters are all tapped, or do you have to attack with Dreadwing the turn he comes into play since your opponent is tapped out?

      <div class="answer">
        Because your turn is over and you’re past the attack and untap steps, you cannot attack again.

        If Dreadwing is equipped with Combat Training and 2 weapons and/or armors, does Combat Training give Dreadwing bold/tough 2 since he has 2 weapons/armors? Same question can be asked for Predaking; Does he get Bold 5 if he has 5 weapons and combat training?

      <div class="answer">
        No. A single Combat Training gives Bold/Tough 1 at most.

        What are Combiners?

      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        It would be hard to have a set called Rise of the Combiners without… the Combiners!<br/>Combiners are teams of characters that join in a third mode called Combiner mode. Most<br/>teams have a corresponding battle card called an Enigma that combines the team under the<br/>right circumstances. One Combiner in this set (Dreadwing - Sky Destroyer) has a different way<br/>of combining.<br/>When a character is combined, it starts untapped and it gets all the damage counters from the<br/>characters that formed it. It can keep upgrades from those characters based on its upgrade<br/>slots. Unless the Combiner says differently, it will have 1 Weapon slot, 1 Utility slot, and 1<br/>Armor slot like most characters. If there are too many Upgrades to fit into a slot, you can keep<br/>as many as you can fit, and the rest are scrapped.<br/>A character in Combiner mode is a single character, even though it’s made up of multiple cards.<br/>When it attacks, the whole thing becomes tapped. If it’s KO’d (and somehow you haven’t lost<br/>the game), it stays in Combiner mode in the KO area.<br/>A character in Combiner mode can’t flip. Ignore any instruction to flip it. Also, a character in<br/>Combiner mode can’t “break apart” into its individual cards.

        You target Blackwing, bring him back and combine. Now, Blackwing is technically gone right? As Dreadwing is its own bot. But you said I Still Function! KO’s Dreadwing.

      <div class="answer">
        As a Combiner, Dreadwing is a mode of Blackwing. Dreadwing is also a mode of Dreadwind.
