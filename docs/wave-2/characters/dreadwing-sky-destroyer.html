If Dreadwing - Sky Destroyer has 2 Spinner Rims attached and flips a white trigger on attacking, does he flip 1 extra battle card for each Spinner Rims attached, or just 1 extra?

      <div class="answer">
        
Both copies of Spinner Rims will trigger and allow you to flip an extra Battle Card, for a total of two, in this scenario.

             What are Combiners?

      <div class="answer">
        
             It would be hard to have a set called Rise of the Combiners without… the Combiners!
Combiners are teams of characters that join in a third mode called Combiner mode. Most
teams have a corresponding battle card called an Enigma that combines the team under the
right circumstances. One Combiner in this set (Dreadwing - Sky Destroyer) has a different way
of combining.
When a character is combined, it starts untapped and it gets all the damage counters from the
characters that formed it. It can keep upgrades from those characters based on its upgrade
slots. Unless the Combiner says differently, it will have 1 Weapon slot, 1 Utility slot, and 1
Armor slot like most characters. If there are too many Upgrades to fit into a slot, you can keep
as many as you can fit, and the rest are scrapped.
A character in Combiner mode is a single character, even though it’s made up of multiple cards.
When it attacks, the whole thing becomes tapped. If it’s KO’d (and somehow you haven’t lost
the game), it stays in Combiner mode in the KO area.
A character in Combiner mode can’t flip. Ignore any instruction to flip it. Also, a character in
Combiner mode can’t “break apart” into its individual cards.
