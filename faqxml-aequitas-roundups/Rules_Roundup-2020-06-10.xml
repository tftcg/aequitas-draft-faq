            <question>
                What does "being upgraded" mean on Gearsâ€™s stratagem Sabotage?
            </question>
            <answer>
                Being upgraded covers any time an upgrade is Put on a character (including Playing, Moving, and Swapping). It does not cover when an upgrade remains on a character during combining.

            <question>
                What happens if I Reprocess to Scrap an Increased Durability on a character with 3 health remaining?
            </question>
            <answer>
                The Increased Durability is scrapped and the character is then KO'd. As the character is now in the KO area, the repair does not happen.

            <question>
                Start Your Engines says "Flip each of your characters from bot mode to Car mode". Does this mean that you can target "Car mode" with Precision Fire? Is Car a mode?
            </question>
            <answer>
                No. Car is a trait and not a mode. Despite this card using 'Car mode', you should consider it as a short hand for 'a mode with the Car trait'. The same is true for Hunker Down's use of Tank mode, and Pop a Wheelie's use of Motorcycle mode.
