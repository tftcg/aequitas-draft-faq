            <question>
                What does "being upgraded" mean on Gearsâ€™s stratagem Sabotage?
            </question>
            <answer>
                Being upgraded covers any time an upgrade is Put on a character (including Playing, Moving, and Swapping). It does not cover when an upgrade remains on a character during combining.

            <question>
                What happens if I Reprocess to Scrap an Increased Durability on a character with 3 health remaining?
            </question>
            <answer>
                The Increased Durability is scrapped and the character is then KO'd. As the character is now in the KO area, the repair does not happen.

            <question>
                Start Your Engines says "Flip each of your characters from bot mode to Car mode". Does this mean that you can target "Car mode" with Precision Fire? Is Car a mode?
            </question>
            <answer>
                No. Car is a trait. Despite the cards using 'mode', you should read Car mode as a short hand for Alt mode with Car trait. The same is true for Hunker Down and Tank mode, and Pop a Wheelie and Motorcycle mode.
