            <question>
                If my opponent has one face up Secret Action and one face down Secret Action, do I do 1 damage to each enemy, or two? 
            </question>
            <answer>
                You would do 2 damage to each enemy. The 'or' in "face up or face down" should be read as 'and/or'.
