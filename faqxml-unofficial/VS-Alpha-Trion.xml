      <question>Can you reflect damage if you have a Holomatter Projector on your only Autobot?</question>
      <answer>
          If a card were to target a character with a Holomatter Projector on it and it is considered a legal target, Reflect Damage can be used to redirect the damage. For example, Sky Shadow - Elite Warrior combines to target an Autobot for 3 damage, and that Autobot is upgraded with Holomatter Projector. It is a legal target and Reflect Damage can be triggered to redirect the damage as its controller sees fit.
