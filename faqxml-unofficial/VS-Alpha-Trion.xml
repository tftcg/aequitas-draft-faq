      <question>
          If I play Scouting Mission and my opponent reveals Reflect Damage, who draws the 2 cards?
      </question>
      <answer>
          The person who receives the damage draws the cards. So in the case of Reflect Damage, it would be the player who the damage was reflected back onto.

      <question>Can you reflect damage if you have a Holomatter Projector on your only Autobot?</question>
      <answer>
          If a card were to target a character with a Holomatter Projector on it and it is considered a legal target, Reflect Damage can be used to redirect the damage. For example, Sky Shadow - Elite Warrior combines to target an Autobot for 3 damage, and that Autobot is upgraded with Holomatter Projector. It is a legal target and Reflect Damage can be triggered to redirect the damage as its controller sees fit.
