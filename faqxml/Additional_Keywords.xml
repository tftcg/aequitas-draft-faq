      <question>What is 'KO Area'?</question>
      <answer>
Most KO'd characters are moved to the KO area (see <a href="https://tftcg.info/keywords/battle-master.html">Battle Master</a> and <a href="https://tftcg.info/keywords/weaponizer.html">Weaponizer</a> for notable exceptons). 
The KO area is usually off to the side of the main battlefield, out of the way of the play but still visible. Note that characters may still be flipped as a part of your flip action, however they cannot be flipped by battle cards unless a card specifically states it can.

      <question>What is a 'Battle Card'?</question>
      <answer>
          Your deck has two types of card in it, cards which are placed on the table at the start of the game and cards that are placed in a face-down stack. The Battle Cards are the cards that are placed in the face-down stack. To date they will say either Action or Upgrade on them on the middle left of the deck, and they are all the same size. They all have the same grey/white/red background image.

        <question>Does Focus stack?</question>
        <answer>
            Yes, Focus stacks. Per the 2.0 Rules; Focus is a single action, so if a character has multiple instances of focus, add the numbers together to determine how many cards to look at. For example, if a character has Focus 1 and is upgraded with a utility that gives it another instance of Focus 1, look at the top two cards of your deck before flipping battle cards. You may scrap any number of them and put the rest back on top of your deck in any order.
