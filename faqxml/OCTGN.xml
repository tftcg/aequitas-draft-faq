      <question>Can I play on Mac OS?</question>
      <answer>
           On Mac OS before 10.15 (Catalina) you should be able to use WINE to play on Mac OS. From 10.15 onwards WINE currently appears to have issues. You could also use a VM to install Windows on top of Mac OS. Note that both of these are non-simple for the average computer user, so don't feel bad if you decide not to try.
