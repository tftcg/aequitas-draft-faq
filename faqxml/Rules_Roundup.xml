I was playing with Bombshell - Decepticon Psy Ops with 5 health left, against Shockwave -Cybertron Commander. I scrapped 11 cards to KO him, but should his bot mode ability have triggered, killing me in the process?
</question>
      <answer>
Shockwave&#x2019;s ability will trigger 11 times, but if those are the last two characters on the battlefield, your opponent will lose the game because Shockwave has been KO&#x2019;d by Bombshell&#x2019;s ability, but Bombshell is not yet KO&#x2019;d by Shockwave&#x2019;s ability.

      <question>
Does Skywarp &#x2013; Teleporting Seeker&#x2019;s bot mode ability trigger when playing a Secret Action from hand since the pip color is hidden information from your opponent? Will his bot mode ability trigger if it is played from the top of the deck via Leap of Faith since the pip color is no longer hidden information?
</question>
      <answer>
Yes, Skywarp&#x2019;s bot mode ability would be triggered by a Secret Action as the battle icon color is hidden. It will still trigger if Leap of Faith plays a Secret Action because at the time you play the Secret Action, the Secret Action has no battle icons (it&#x2019;s not very secret).

      <question>
Can you scrap cards from your hand? This came up from playing a lot of the Turbo format with my kids. Inevitably someone had one or two cards that you couldn&#x2019;t play with the characters. If you&#x2019;re allowed to scrap them from your hand when drawn it would still allow those cards to be useful for the pips when battling.
</question>
      <answer>
You cannot scrap cards from your hand for no reason or simply because you&#x2019;d like to, but there are a plethora of effects in the game (such as green battle icons) that allow you to swap cards in and out of your hand.

      <question>
Grapple reads you get an attack/defence bonus for flipping battle icons of "exactly 4 different colors". What happens when you flip MORE than 4 colors during your turn, say green, orange, white, green and black? Does his ability still trigger? And does this also apply to his ability on other side of the card?
</question>
      <answer>
If a number of *colors* other than four colors is flipped, Grapple&#x2019;s bot mode ability will not trigger. For his alt mode ability, you can still scrap your hand, but you will only do damage if you&#x2019;ve scrapped exactly four different battle icon colors.

Editor&#x2019;s note: It&#x2019;s important when considering Grapple&#x2019;s abilities to make a distinction between the number of battle icon *colors* and the number of battle icons. So long as the number of battle icon colors is exactly 4, the number of cards they appear on do not matter. So, in the scenario described in this question, his ability would trigger as four colors appear, even though there are multiple instances of a green battle icon.

If I open a card in a Limited Format that says "grab a card from outside the game" am I allowed to dip into my personal collection for this (assuming I brought it ahead of time) or just the sideboard of my Limited Pool? If I have a lesser collection (or am just lazy), am I allowed to use cards from my Sideboard for my Outside-of-the-Game-Board? Or is this a Head Judge for an event decision?
</question>
      <answer>
For casual play, you are allowed to use whatever parameters your play group has decided on. For competitive play, in Limited, you are only allowed to draw &#x201C;outside the game&#x201D; cards from your Limited pool.

Editor&#x2019;s Note: In our initial ruling, we misstated our answer and accidentally ruled that &#x201C;outside the game&#x201D; cards must be limited to one&#x2019;s sideboard. This is incorrect.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but you can put Decepticon Cassettes underneath Blaster and vice-versa with Soundwave since they are "Mini-Cassettes". Does this count as starting the game with Decepticon characters or Autobot characters or are they effectively "out of the game"?

Yes, any Mini-Cassette can be put under Blaster or Soundwave regardless of faction. Any Mini-Cassettes you start the game with count toward your starting team.

For example, if Soundwave was KO&#x2019;d with Buzzsaw still under him, you would have Soundwave in KO, fully damaged with Buzzsaw underneath him with no damage. You could not I Still Function Buzzsaw, but if you ISF&#x2019;d Soundwave, Buzzsaw would remain underneath him when Soundwave returned to the battlefield. At the end of the turn, when Soundwave is KO&#x2019;d again, Buzzsaw would return to KO with him unless you had deployed Buzzsaw during that turn, in which case, Buzzsaw would remain on the battlefield.

Blaster and Soundwave have the ability to add the cassettes from your starting line up under three when the game starts. This is different to Metroplex text because the card under him start under him and aren&#x2019;t in your lineup. So, if you play either blaster or sound wave with all three cassettes it would make your starting lineup 25 stars. Since both have the text your star cost is then raised by one when does that mean you can only play Blaster/Soundwave with two cassettes? Seeing as 10 + (5+1) + (5+1) would equal 22, there for having the exact number of star cards for each theme deck bringing it to its cap of 25 stars. Would this be correct, or am I reading the card wrong?

How do I use a Micromaster&#x2019;s tap ability? Let's say Raider Detour. I tap Raider Detour, then scrap a card with a blue battle icon, and draw my 2 cards. Does that mean I have used Raider Detour and now I attack with one of my other characters?
</question>
      <answer>
You can still play an Action or Upgrade if you haven&#x2019;t and would like to, but then you can move on. Each turn, you can use one tap ability. Raider Detour will not be able to attack because he is tapped. However if he were untapped somehow, he would still be able to attack.

My friends and I played a game where Metroplex had Six-Gun deployed in alt mode. The defending player had a tapped character with 1 health left and an untapped, undamaged character. Metroplex converted into bot mode and attacked the character, and Six-Gun's ability KO&#x2019;d the defending character. Does Metroplex still flip battle cards to see if it can use the bot mode ability or does the death of the tapped character mean the attack stops?

No, Metroplex does not flip battle cards in this scenario.

The question I have today is in regard to attacking with Anticipation Engine. I am playing with a combiner team, and I have just converted my last character. I don't have the Enigma in my hand to play it, so I play a different action instead. I attack using a character with Anticipation Engine, and flip the Enigma. Am I able to play it, transform, and continue the attack with the Combiner, or does my attack get cancelled and it becomes my opponent's turn? (This is because the Enigma has the Combiner enter play untapped) Update to the question, as I see it was already answered in a previous Rules Round-up.
Anticipation Engine + Enigma = Transformed and attacking, but untapped
You said the character was untapped, but still attacking. Does this mean that my opponent can only attack with one character if they have multiple available?

So Major Shockwave's ability where he can play Decepticon cards or secret actions on the top of the player's deck as though they were in the player's hand, does this mean at any time since his other ability allows the player to look at the top of their deck at any time?

I have run into a situation where my deck had no cards and no discard pile to shuffle in. We ruled it as when I attacked or defended, I had no cards to flip so I added 0 to my attack and defense. We were wondering if this would be a proper ruling. Second, for the card Inverted. It says that for each orange pip you flip becomes a blue pip and vice versa. For cards that rely on you flipping a certain color pip, do the pips flipped count as what they are or the inverted color?

When you have no deck left, you just don&#x2019;t flip any cards. Inverted&#x2019;s effect applies immediately. For example, if an ability triggers whenever you flip two orange icons, and you flip two blue icons under Inverted (meaning the cards literally have blue icons printed on them), that ability will trigger.

I was wondering about Sergeant Chromia from Wave 3 and how the Alt mode flip ability works.

Sergeant Chromia&#x2019;s flip ability asks you to play a blue armor right then. If you don&#x2019;t, you&#x2019;ve forfeited the opportunity to do so.

        </question>
      <answer>
That&#x2019;s correct. In this scenario you would be attacking for 4 with Pierce 6. Pierce stacks on Pierce, but not on regular attack damage.

Optimus Prime, Gleaming Commander attacks Private Lionizer, knocking him out. Lionizer changes to RS Firesteel Saber, onto another of my characters, but Optimus Prime triggers his bot mode ability, and uses it to transform Prowl, Strategic Mastermind in my opponent&#x2019;s KO area, which then transforms to Prowl&#x2019;s bot mode and triggers his bot mode ability to remove a weapon. My opponent scraps RS Firesteel Saber. This all happened as a result of my opponent&#x2019;s attack- is this the correct order of play?
        </question>
      <answer>
Not quite. There are two errors in the scenario you&#x2019;re describing. The first is that Optimus&#x2019; trigger will resolve before damage is dealt to Lionizer. The second, is that your Optimus can only choose characters in your KO Area, so you would not be able to flip any characters in your opponent&#x2019;s KO Area.

The question I have today is in regard to attacking with Anticipation Engine. I am playing with a combiner team, and I have just converted my last character. I don't have the Enigma in my hand to play it, so I play a different action instead. I attack using a character with Anticipation Engine and flip the Enigma. Am I able to play it, transform, and continue the attack with the Combiner, or does my attack get cancelled and it becomes my opponent's turn? (This is because the Enigma has the Combiner enter play untapped)

Update to the question, as I see it was already answered in a previous Rules Round-up.

&#x201C;Anticipation Engine + Enigma = Transformed and attacking, but untappedYou said the character was untapped, but still attacking. Does this mean that my opponent can only attack with one character if they have multiple available?

If I attack with a character that is upgraded with an anticipation engine and the first card flipped is an action that untaps my attacking character, such as Start Your Engines in a cars deck, does my character still count as attacking? Does it still flip battlecards for attack? Does my opponent need to wait for me to attack with the same, or another, character?

Another similar confluence of mechanics would be OPBL flipping a swap missions during attack and untapping. I know the effects and triggers are at slightly different points in the attack but the result is broadly the same; an attacker that hasn&#x2019;t tapped out that round.
Is this intended?

Changing the tapped/untapped status of a character does not affect whether it is attacking or not. At the end of that attack, if your opponent has any untapped characters, your turn ends. Otherwise, continue attacking with any of your untapped characters.

      <question>
Since it sounds like (understandably) that a comprehensive rules document might take a while, perhaps you could answer a more specific timing question then.

Taken to a corner case, how would a player properly process an attack in the following scenario.

Your team:

Specialist Flamewar in bot mode equipped with an Anticipation Engine in her weapon slot, a Metal Detector in her Utility slot. She has Focus 2 from her bot mode ability.

Her teammate, Raider Aimless has a Decepticon Crown equipped in his Utility slot giving out Plan 1 when a Decepticon attacks.

Her other teammate General Optimus Prime is in Alt Mode giving Bold 1 and Tough 1 to his teammates.

What would be the proper sequence of triggers when Specialist Flamewar initiates an attack? Which goes first Plan, Focus, the Equipment Triggers? Which Equipment Triggers first? Can both trigger on the same combat if you have an equipment and an action (or vice versa) as your top 2 cards?
        </question>
      <answer>
When Specialist Flamewar attacks, the abilities of Anticipation Engine, Metal Detector, and Decepticon Crown will all trigger. As the attacking player, you will resolve all of those abilities in the order of your choosing, one at a time. Then you will use your Focus ability. Then, you will flip battle cards, including an extra from General Optimus&#x2019; Bold 1.

      <question>
As is my understanding, the majority of infractions which occur in the Transformers TCG can easily be addressed through other resources such as the WPN Tournament rules document, but I feel there are some situations which are exclusive to the Transformers TCG. In particular, what should occur when a player forgets to draw their card at the beginning of the turn, and neither player realizes until after combat flips have occurred? Obviously not drawing a card in this instance has the possibility to be advantageous for the active player.
My second question is similar but slightly different. How does the above ruling pertain to situations when the card draw is from a triggered ability, such as Private Firedrive's attack trigger?
        </question>
      <answer>
As long as it&#x2019;s still the same turn, the player should just draw the card when the error is noticed. It usually doesn&#x2019;t matter if the card they draw isn&#x2019;t the card they would have drawn had they drawn at the right time. However, if the player has gained knowledge of the top card of their deck or manipulated it in some way, such as with Plan, you can back up if possible, or come to another mutually agreed upon solution, such as drawing the second card of their deck. If you&#x2019;re in a tournament, a Judge should be notified as soon as the error is discovered. It doesn&#x2019;t matter whether the draw is from the normal start of turn or from a triggered ability or something else.

Finally, how does Dreadwing Sky Destroyer&#x2019;s combine ability work with this scenario? Does the &#x201C;untap step&#x201D; happen before the end of turn step? Do they happen in a sequence of the active player&#x2019;s choice? Or does the untapping of all characters happen even before this?

Characters untap before the end of turn step, so you both players would untap all of their characters, then you could combine Dreadwing, then your opponent could start their turn.

This was written in Rules Roundup 10/11/19:
&#x201C;I play Brainstorm. Using my 2 actions, I play Ancient Wisdom first, then System Reboot. I draw Unleash Potential off of System Reboot, do I get to play it for free now?
Both Brainstorm and Ancient Wisdom resolve &#x201C;top to bottom&#x201D;. When you play Brainstorm, then you play Ancient Wisdom, you must play Unleash Potential at that moment. In your case, you&#x2019;ve moved past Ancient Wisdom and are continuing with Brainstorm, playing System Reboot. It&#x2019;s now too late to play Unleash Potential with your previous Ancient Wisdom.&#x201D;
Would this rule also apply to Tech Research? You must play a Superior upgrade after playing Tech Research or else that Tech Research is not forfeit. Example: I play Brainstorm first, then I play Tech Research, then I play Medic. Can I play Superior Jetpack?
        </question>
      <answer>
Superior upgrades only check to see if you have played Tech Research at some point previously in your turn. Therefore, there is no issue with playing other cards between Tech Research and a Superior upgrade.

Your Ancient Wisdom allows you to play a single Unleash Potential. After you&#x2019;ve played Tech Research, the number of Superior upgrades you can play is only limited by the number of upgrades you can play.

So, let's say we have Omega Supreme (Base), (Spaceship), and (Tank) verses Kickback, Shrapnel, Barrage and Ransack. No side has any KO bots.  All bots on Omega's team is tapped. Shrapnel and Barrage are tapped.  It's the Insecticons turn with Kickback and Ransack untapped and ready to attack. They have 4 battlecards in their deck. They send Kickback to attack Omega Supreme (Tank). Kickback needs to flip at least 8 Battlecards, so 4 Battlecards are first flipped, causing their deck to be reshuffled.  Captain Omega Supreme then formed. Kickback continues his same attack now onto Captain Omega Supreme, flipping at least 4 more battlecards. The player with Omega NOW gets to flip for defending. Since Captain Omega Supreme is now untapped, Ransack is no longer able to attack, thus ending the turn of the Insecticons.

I play Brainstorm, then Ancient Wisdom and System Reboot. My new hand is Multi-Mission Gear, Brainstorm, and 2 Unleashed Potential. Can I play Mutli-Mission Gear, then Brainstorm, and then both Unleashed Potentials?
        </question>
      <answer>
Let&#x2019;s walk through this whole play. You play Brainstorm and your first action is Ancient Wisdom. Ancient Wisdom has you scrap the top two cards of your deck and put an Action and/or Upgrade from among the scrapped cards into your hand. At this point, you can play Unleash Potential, if it&#x2019;s in your hand.
Let&#x2019;s say you do. You get a card with 1 star from outside the game and put it into your hand. This may not be a great idea, because you then play the second action from Brainstorm, which is System Reboot. You scrap your hand (including that fancy star card you just snagged) and draw 4 cards.
But instead, let&#x2019;s say you don&#x2019;t play Unleash Potential. That brings you to the end of Ancient Wisdom and now you System Reboot just as above.
In either case, your new hand is Multi-Mission Gear, Brainstorm, and 2 Unleash Potentials. You&#x2019;ve already played an Action this turn, so we&#x2019;re guessing you&#x2019;ll now play Multi-Mission Gear. This allows you to play an Action such as Brainstorm. Brainstorm will allow you to play 2 Unleash Potentials. You played Ancient Wisdom earlier in your turn, so you can get two 1-star cards from outside the game.

If you have Trypticon untapped initially, and your opponents&#x2019; characters are also all untapped, and I play Relentless Invasion to bring back Wipe Out, Full Tilt and Brunt, since the effect of Invasion allows you to attack with them all, can Trypticon attack as well?
        </question>
      <answer>
Yes. The attack granted to his three minions is in addition to your normal attack that turn.

If Nightbird attacks with a Contract Contingency and it triggers Nightbird&#x2019;s bounty, can I take another Contract Contingency from my opponent&#x2019;s scrap pile, play this, then trigger Nightbird&#x2019;s bounty again?
Or can you only trigger Contract Contingency once because you are not getting 4 or more attack damage through after applying the plus 2 to the already finished attack?
        </question>
      <answer>
The second Contract Contingency won&#x2019;t trigger because it will be played after the attack damage has been done.

I have 4 cards in my hand and my opponent has Decepticon Shockwave in Bot mode. If they play Brainstorm &gt; System Reboot &gt; System Reboot, do I take 4 damage after each System Reboot or 8 damage after Brainstorm is resolved?
        </question>
      <answer>
Shockwave&#x2019;s ability will trigger a total of 8 times. Each of those abilities resolves separately, so essentially you have 8 damage counters to spread around as you wish.

      <question>
Using the above scenario, my character is Nightbird in alt mode. What is the timing there? Does the Shockwave player take 1 damage each time an action hits the play area or after the Brainstorm resolves?
I.E. My Nightbird is at full HP (11) and his Shockwave is at 3.  Who wins?
        </question>
      <answer>
Here's what happens. Your opponent starts to play Brainstorm, this causes Nightbird&#x2019;s ability to trigger, but that effect doesn&#x2019;t resolve immediately. Continuing to resolve Brainstorm, your opponent then plays System Reboot. Another Nightbird trigger happens, which, again, doesn&#x2019;t resolve immediately. The System Reboot resolves, causing Shockwave to trigger four times. Continuing to resolve Brain Storm, your opponent then plays the second System Reboot. This causes another Nightbird trigger. The second System Reboot causes another four Shockwave triggers. Now that Brainstorm has resolved, we start resolving triggers, beginning with the ones that triggered most recently and working backwards. The four Shockwave triggers caused by the second System Reboot happen one at a time. Next, the Nightbird trigger caused by the second System Reboot happens. Next, the Shockwave triggers caused by the first System Reboot happens. Next, the Nightbird trigger caused by the first System Reboot happens. And finally, the Nightbird trigger caused by the Brain Storm happens. At any point, if resolving one of these triggers causes a player to KO their last character, that player loses the game. If Shockwave was at 3 and Nightbird was at 8 at the beginning of this sequence, Nightbird is going to lose.

The answer from the last rules roundup states that the new combiners (Omega Supreme and Skytread) keep all upgrades and damage when they combine. Even with that explanation, rule enforcers where I play tell me that it doesn't apply to the KO'd Skytread's upgrades and that those upgrades are scrapped during the KO process before Revenge combining takes place and do not transfer to the combined Skytread. Can I please get a specific ruling on this?
        </question>
      <answer>
Upgrades attached to the Skytread half that gets KO&#x2019;d are scrapped at the same time. Those upgrades can&#x2019;t be put on Raider Skytread.

Let's say, in theory, Lockdown has a 4 cards in hand, along with a Weapon, Armor, Utility, and one card underneath him.  Lockdown flips to his alt mode, allowing him to draw 4 discard 4, but I reveal Hijack.

You draw the 4 cards. The Lockdown player would have to scrap 4 cards. That poor, sweet fool has been Hijacked.

No. It scraps as a result of a triggered ability, which does not trigger again. You would have to somehow attack a second time.

My question is about the interaction of Debilitating Crystal and the new Expanded Rules document. If my attacker has a Debilitating Crystal, and the Defender has a Gyro Blaster I wish to return, I believe the Gyro Blaster would still limit each character to 2 flips this battle. Is this correct? I know a previous Rules Roundup clarified that a Security Console would still Draw and Plan even if a Debilitating Crystal returned it. Is this also the case with a Sparring Gear I wish to return? Do they still have Tough 2 this battle?
        </question>
      <answer>
Expanded Rules point 8.5 indicates the Gyro Blaster is returned before flips are determined, so it will not affect them. Likewise, Sparring Gear will no longer grant Tough 2 when flips are determined.

Beginning player here, not sure where else to go for clarification in general. My buddy and I played a killer game with Insecticons (me) v Special Ops Specialists (buddy). All three of his characters had Safeguard. I swung into one of them (undamaged) with Raider Kickback (bot) and flipped one blue and several orange. My thinking was the one damage from Kickback's ability would eliminate the Safeguard, thus allowing all combat damage to be applied. Then came the confusion. I believe his thinking was that all the damage came at once, prevented to some degree by Safeguard. After scouring stupid Google for help to no avail, I decided to simply concede to his perspective and move the game along. He won, but it was close, and it would have been a drastically different story had all that combat damage been applied.
Kickback&#x2019;s ability does 1 Damage before Attack damage is applied, thus disabling Safeguard. Congratulations on your crushing theoretical victory!
