If you want it in the Utility slot, put it below the character, where a Utility would normally go. Once Mounted Missiles is in a slot, it can&#x2019;t move to another slot.

      <question>Let&#x2019;s say I play this and choose my opponent&#x2019;s Decepticon with 1 defense. Later in the turn, it gets +2 defense. What will its total defense be?</question>
      <answer>1. Press the Advantage won&#x2019;t drop the Decepticon&#x2019;s defense below 0, but the -2 applies again once the Decepticon&#x2019;s defense is raised.</answer>

      <question>Can you give me an example of how this card works?</question>
      <answer>Sure. Let&#x2019;s say your opponent has a character with 12 health and 9 damage counters on it.  You attack with the chosen character and would do 6 damage to it. That&#x2019;s 3 more than you need to KO the defender, so your opponent chooses one of their other characters and puts 3 damage counters on it.</answer>

      <question>What if your opponent puts those 3 damage counters on a character with 10 health and 9 damage counters already on it? Do the extra damage counters on go to a third character?</question>
      <answer>No. The &#x201C;Steamroll damage&#x201D; only carries over to one other character. That 10-health character would end up in the KO area with 10 damage counters on it. The extra 2 damage counters are lost.</answer>

      <question>If I want to play a Weapon on the upgraded character, do I choose which slot it goes in?</question>
      <answer>Yes. If you want the Weapon in its Armor slot, put it to the right of Megatron, where an Armor would normally go. Once the Weapon is in a slot, it can&#x2019;t move to another slot. This means that if you put a Weapon into its Armor slot, you&#x2019;d have to scrap that Weapon if later you wanted to play an Armor on it.</answer>

      <question>When determining if the character has 7 stars or fewer, does it matter which mode it&#x2019;s in?</question>
      <answer>No. A character always has the number of stars printed on it, no matter which mode it&#x2019;s in.</answer>

      <question>If the upgraded character defends against an enemy that has pierce 1, what happens?</question>
      <answer>If a character&#x2019;s pierce total is 0 or lower, treat that character as if it didn&#x2019;t have pierce when determining how much damage is done. Pierce -1 doesn&#x2019;t do anything weird.</answer>

      <question>If Repurpose is the last card in my hand when I play it, what happens?</question>
      <answer>Well, you can&#x2019;t scrap a card from your hand if you don&#x2019;t have any, so you skip that part and just draw 2 cards.</answer>

      <question>What happens if one of us is supposed to flip more than 2 cards during the battle?</question>
      <answer>The extra cards are simply not flipped. It doesn&#x2019;t matter whether those extra flips were because of abilities like bold, a white battle icon, or any other ability.</answer>
