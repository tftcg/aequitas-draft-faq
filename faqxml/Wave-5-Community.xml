        <question>
             How many stars does a Titan Master (Head mode + Body mode) cost?
        </question>
        <answer>
            For the purposes of building a deck, both the Head and the Body star costs are included in the 25-star limit unless otherwise stated.

            For the purposes of the cost of the character, then both the Head and Body apply. For example, a 7-star Body with a 4-star Head is 11-stars and thus can use an Energy Pack.

                Can you I Still Function a character with a Body mode?
            </question>
            <answer>
                <!-- Content in a WotC article I believe -->
                You can't bring back a Body mode character from KO because it won't have a head. Effects like I Still Function! and Involuntary Promotion will not work at all to bring back a Body. You can, however, bring back a Head from KO because it will be in Bot mode (and only in Bot mode).

          <question>
            Does a card that refers to Bot Mode apply to a Titan Master (Head + Body mode)?
          </question>
          <answer>
            No. A character in Body mode is not also in Bot mode.

            This means that cards like Escape Route do not flip a Body mode character to Alt mode. For an example of a card that works with both Body mode and Bot mode characters, look at how Mission Briefing explicitly says 'in bot mode or body mode'. 
            Note that cards like Start Your Engines and Hunker Down do not flip the characters from Body mode to Alt mode, however if the characters have Car and Tank traits respectively, they still get the secondary effects of those cards.
