        <question>
             How many stars does a Titan Master (Head mode + Body mode) cost?
        </question>
        <answer>
            For the purposes of building a deck, both the Head and the Body star costs are included in the 25-star limit unless otherwise stated.

            For the purposes of the cost of the character, then both the Head and Body apply. For example, a 7-star Body with a 4-star Head is 11-stars and thus can use an Energy Pack.

                Can you I Still Function a character with a Body mode?

            <answer>
                <!-- Content in a WotC article I believe -->
                You can't bring back a Body mode character from KO because it won't have a head. Effects like I Still Function! and Involuntary Promotion will not work at all to bring back a Body. You can, however, bring back a Head from KO because it will be in Bot mode (and only in Bot mode).
