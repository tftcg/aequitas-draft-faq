      <question>
    Assuming I want to use Brainstorm to play two more Actions, how do I order them?
</question>
      <answer>
    First, choose your first Action. Carry out all its instructions and set it aside. Then choose your second Action and carry out its instructions. Note that you don&#x2019;t have to choose the Actions ahead of time. For example, if your first Action lets you draw a card, and that card is an Action, you could play that Action as your second one.

      <question>
    Do I draw a card before doing the other parts of the effect?
</question>
      <answer>
    Yes. If a card tells you to do multiple things, always do them in order. First, you&#x2019;ll draw a card. Then you scrap an enemy Upgrade. Finally, your opponent scraps a card from their hand. (This means they&#x2019;ll know what Upgrade you scrap before deciding what card to scrap from their hand.)

      <question>
    Who picks their Weapon to scrap first? Who picks a card in their hand to scrap first?
</question>
      <answer>
    Any time both players are given the same instruction, the player whose turn it is goes first. If you play Collateral Damage, first you&#x2019;ll scrap a Weapon from one of your characters, then your opponent will, then you&#x2019;ll scrap a card from your hand, and finally your opponent will.

    Can I play Collateral Damage if none of my characters have a Weapon or if I won&#x2019;t have any other cards in my hand?
</question>
      <answer>
    Yes. You can always play an Action card, even if you can&#x2019;t carry out some of its instructions. Just do as much as you can.

    Does Force Field work against damage done by a character with Pierce?

      <question>
    Let&#x2019;s say the Upgraded character also has Heroism. If another character would take 5 or more attack damage, what happens?
</question>
      <answer>
    The damage that would be done to the defender is instead done to the character with Heroism and Force Field. That damage is still attack damage, so 4 damage is done to the Upgraded character instead.

      <question>
    If Optimus Prime, Battlefield Legend attacks, and the Action I play puts a Grenade Launcher onto him, will that Grenade Launcher be scrapped?
</question>
      <answer>
    Yes. After the battle, Grenade Launcher will see that the character it&#x2019;s upgrading has attacked and its ability will make you scrap it. Similarly, if a character that has a Grenade Launcher attacks, but somehow no longer has that Grenade Launcher after the battle (say, because a Swap Parts put it on a different character), Grenade Launcher won&#x2019;t be scrapped.

    Any character in alt mode, as well as characters who are in bot mode but whose alt mode isn&#x2019;t a Tank, doesn&#x2019;t flip. Then each Tank, whether it flipped or not, can get an Armor from your scrap pile.

      <question>
    How many damage counters does a character in the KO area have?
</question>
      <answer>
    A KO&#x2019;d character has damage counters on it equal to its health. Note that this is true even if it took more damage while on the battlefield. For example, if a character with 7 health takes 10 damage, it ends up in the KO area with 7 damage counters. If you return it with I Still Function!, it will end up with 6 damage counters.
