      <question>What happens if I play this card with 2 cards left in my deck?</question>
      <answer>Whenever a card tells you to scrap (or reveal) cards from the top of your deck and then do something else with those cards, those cards aren&#x2019;t included in the reshuffle. So you&#x2019;ll scrap the top two cards, shuffle all other cards in your scrap pile into your deck, then return one or both scrapped cards to your hand, depending on what they are.</answer>

      <question>What happens if I play this card with 1 card left in my deck?</question>
      <answer>In that case, you&#x2019;ll scrap the one card and shuffle all other cards in your scrap pile into your deck. Then scrap the new top card of your deck, meaning you&#x2019;ve scrapped a total of two cards.  Then return one or both scrapped cards to your hand, depending on what they are.</answer>

      <question>What happens if a card tries to move damage counters to the upgraded character?</question>

      <question>Who scraps cards from their hand first?</question>
      <answer>Actually, you each scrap cards at the same time. Each player should choose the cards they&#x2019;re going to scrap and set them aside without revealing them. Once both players are ready, they turn them face up and put them in their scrap pile.</answer>

      <question>Can I put Mounted Missiles into a Weapon slot?</question>
      <answer>Yes. It can go into an Armor or Utility slot, but it doesn&#x2019;t have to.</answer>
    </entry>
    <entry>
      <question>If I play Mounted Missiles on a character, do I have to choose which slot it&#x2019;s going in?</question>
      <answer>Yes. If you want it in the Armor slot, put it to the right of the character, where an Armor would normally go. If you want it in the Utility slot, put it below the character, where a Utility would normally go. Once Mounted Missiles is in a slot, it can&#x2019;t move to another slot. This means that if you put it into a character&#x2019;s Armor slot, you&#x2019;d have to scrap Mounted Missiles if later you wanted to play an Armor on it.</answer>

      <question>Let&#x2019;s say I flip 3 battle cards (the normal 2 + 1 for Recon System) and there&#x2019;s a white battle icon there. Do I scrap one for Recon System&#x2019;s effect immediately or do I flip the 2 extra cards?</question>

  <target name="Steamroll">
    <entry>
      <question>Can you give me an example of how this card works?</question>
      <answer>Sure. Let&#x2019;s say your opponent has a character with 12 health and 9 damage counters on it.  You attack with the chosen character and would do 6 damage to it. That&#x2019;s 3 more than you need to KO the defender, so your opponent chooses one of their other characters and puts 3 damage counters on it.</answer>
    </entry>
    <entry>
      <question>What if your opponent puts those 3 damage counters on a character with 10 health and 9 damage counters already on it? Do the extra damage counters on go to a third character?</question>
      <answer>No. The &#x201C;Steamroll damage&#x201D; only carries over to one other character. That 10-health character would end up in the KO area with 10 damage counters on it. The extra 2 damage counters are lost.</answer>
    </entry>
    <entry>
      <question>Does the damage counters my opponent puts on another character count as attack damage?</question>
      <answer>Yes. The damage counters represent attack damage done by the chosen character.</answer>

  <target name="Tooth and Claw">
    <entry>
      <question>If I want to play a Weapon on the upgraded character, do I choose which slot it goes in?</question>
      <answer>Yes. If you want the Weapon in its Armor slot, put it to the right of Megatron, where an Armor would normally go. Once the Weapon is in a slot, it can&#x2019;t move to another slot. This means that if you put a Weapon into its Armor slot, you&#x2019;d have to scrap that Weapon if later you wanted to play an Armor on it.</answer>

      <question>If I have a Weapon in the upgraded character&#x2019;s Armor slot and Tooth and Claw is removed from the character, what happens to the Weapon?</question>
      <answer>It stays where it is. Once an Upgrade is legally put into a slot, removing what made it legal to put it there doesn&#x2019;t matter.</answer>
